## 🧩 MongoDB + Node.js with Docker Compose — Project Overview

### ⚙️ Goal

Set up a **Git-tracked project folder** containing a `docker-compose.yml` that launches two coordinated containers:

1. A **MongoDB** service (database layer)
    
2. A **Node.js backend** (application layer) that connects to the database
    

This setup ensures a **fully local, portable, and reproducible** development environment without relying on external cloud services.

### 🧠 Why This Setup Is Viable

- **[[The Compose|The Docker Compose]]** allows you to define multi-container environments in one file.
    
- Each container is isolated but can communicate with others via a shared **Docker network** (auto-created by Compose).
    
- You can reproduce the same environment on any machine that has Docker + Docker Compose, regardless of OS or local installations.
    
- The MongoDB data can persist across container restarts using **volumes**.
    
- The Node.js service can automatically start after MongoDB, ensuring the app connects correctly.

### 📦 Folder Structure Overview

You’ll eventually have something like this (conceptually):
```
project-root/
├── docker-compose.yml        # Defines MongoDB + Node services
├── backend/                  # Node.js application folder
│   ├── package.json
│   ├── src/
│   └── ...
└── data/                     # Local folder for MongoDB volumeMongoDB volume

```

>You’ll track all of this with Git, so any collaborator can clone the repo and run the stack immediately with a single `docker-compose up` command.

### 🔄 Project Outline

1. **Initialize Git Repository**
    
    - Create your project folder and initialize Git (`git init`).
        
    - Add a `.gitignore` to exclude `node_modules`, `data`, and other generated files.
        
2. **Define Services in Docker Compose**
    
    - The `mongo` service runs an official MongoDB image, exposing the default port (27017) and optionally mapping a local volume for data persistence.
        
    - The `backend` service builds a Node.js app from a local `backend/` folder and connects to MongoDB using the internal service name (e.g., `mongodb://mongo:27017`).
        
3. **Networking and Environment**
    
    - Both services share the same Docker network created by Compose.
        
    - Environment variables (like `MONGO_URI`) are defined in the Compose file or in a `.env` file.
        
    - The backend can depend on the MongoDB container to ensure correct startup order.
        
4. **Portability and Reuse**
    
    - Anyone can clone the repository and run the same setup — no need for global MongoDB or Node.js installations.
        
    - The containers ensure consistent versions and dependencies across systems.
        
    - You can easily extend the setup (e.g., add an API gateway, frontend, or test runner) later.
