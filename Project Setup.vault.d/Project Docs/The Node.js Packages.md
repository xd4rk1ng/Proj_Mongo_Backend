## ðŸ”¹ What is **npm**?

**npm** stands for **Node Package Manager**. Itâ€™s the default tool that comes with Node.js for managing packages (also called modules or libraries) in your Node.js projects.

Think of npm as a **library manager + command-line tool** that allows you to:

1. **Install packages**: Download and use code that someone else wrote, like `express` or `mongoose`.
    
2. **Manage dependencies**: Keep track of which packages your project needs in `package.json`.
    
3. **Run scripts**: Execute common tasks like starting your app or running tests through commands in `package.json`.

 `backend/packages.json`:
```json
{
  "name": "backend",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Node.js backend for MongoDB project",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js"
  },
  "author": "Your Name",
  "license": "MIT",
  "dependencies": {
    "mongoose": "^7.6.0"
  }
}
```

### How **npm** Works in Your Project

When you run:
```bash
npm install mongoose
```
**npm** does two things:

1. Adds `mongoose` to your **package.json** under `"dependencies"`.
    
2. Downloads the actual code into a folder called **node_modules/** in your project.
    

Your app can now use Mongoose like this:
```bash
RUN npm install
```

### Explanation

- `"name"` and `"version"`: Basic metadata for your project.
    
- `"main"`: Entry point of your app (`index.js` in this case).
    
- `"scripts"`: Defines commands you can run with `npm run start`.
    
- `"dependencies"`: Lists the packages your app needs. `mongoose` is included here, so `npm install` (or `RUN npm install` in the Dockerfile) installs it automatically inside the container.
